Hi ! I'm a 1/2-french 1/2-japanese ex-opera singer, with a background in digital, sound and installation art, freshly graduated from Epitech Coding Academy 2021. [More about my atypical journey...](../../../resume)

I'm particularly enthusiastic about anything related to **Computer Vision and NLP** and their application in **humane, ethical and open-source workspaces**.

I'm currently doing an internship as a Data Engineer among the R&D team at [data2i](https://www.data2i.fr/) where I'm building an **industry-oriented Human-Machine Interface**. From state-of-the-art of relevant technologies to MVP and presentation to potential clients, I'm conducting every step of the project from start to (*fingers crossed*) finish with the regular oversight of the data scientist in our team.

I'm curious and eager to learn. Yesterday, now and tomorrow.
